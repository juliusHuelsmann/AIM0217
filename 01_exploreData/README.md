In this directory you can find data, scripts and vizualisations regarding our data exploration analysis. The folder structure is as follows

* out : folder where you need to place the train and test splits of the data in the corresponding folders. The check folder will contain the read and output data after a spark execution
* raw : folder where the downloaded raw dataset should be placed
* unusedExploration : datasets and the corresponding plot that were explored but not used for the experiments

The scripts can be used to execute the data exploration plots.
